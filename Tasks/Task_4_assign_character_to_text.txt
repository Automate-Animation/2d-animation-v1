Review the following text carefully. Based on the text, provide instructions for each character that would look natural as if you were engaging with the story.
Given the following list of characters and their types:

```
{'1': {'name': 'Hero', 'type': 'Protagonist'}, '2': {'name': 'Villain', 'type': 'Antagonist'}, '3': {'name': 'Sidekick', 'type': 'Supporting'}, '4': {'name': 'Mentor', 'type': 'Supporting'}}

```
Given the list of characters above, the characters should align with the narrative flow and emphasize key elements of the story without being overly dynamic.

    If the text is a dialogue between characters:
        Determine how many characters are speaking.
        Provide their IDs and the ranges of their dialogue based on the word count.

    If the text is a monologue (one person speaking):

        Indicate their ID and the range of the text they are speaking.

Hey, remember that hike we did last weekend? It was amazing!
Totally! The views were breathtaking, and the fresh air was so invigorating.
I know, right? I felt like I was on top of the world. And that little waterfall we stumbled upon was such a pleasant surprise.
Me too! I love how nature can just pop up like that. It's like a hidden treasure.
Speaking of treasures, I found this really cool rock on the way back down. It has this unique pattern on it.
Wow, that's awesome! Can I see it?
Sure. Here.
It's beautiful! You should keep it as a souvenir.
Maybe I will. I'll definitely frame it and hang it up.
That's a great idea. It'll be a constant reminder of that unforgettable adventure.
